**Summary**

After returning from Toronto and noticing Montreal's nascent community-building scene, I decided to create something new with a few builder friends. We launched 555 nights - a demo evening with a simple format: 5 slides, 5 minutes, 5 minutes of Q&A.

The concept is straightforward: creators, builders, and curious minds gather in the cozy space of Building 21 to share their passions and projects. Each presenter gets exactly 5 minutes to walk through 5 slides about something they're diving deep into - whether it's a side project, research interest, or creative pursuit. This is followed by 5 minutes of engaging Q&A with the audience.

The format creates a perfect balance - enough time to meaningfully share your work, but brief enough to keep energy high and attention focused. We provided amazing chai and snacks to fuel the conversations.

**Origin Story**

Thanks for sticking around seems like you have an extra 5 minutes in your day, let me take you through the origin story of 555.

_October 14_

I had been thinking of this idea of doing a presentation night for a while, but decided less overthinking and just execute. If I wanted to create something, I can just go and do it and that's what I set out to do.

On October 14th, I created a groupchat on Instagram with a couple of friends and this was how 555 was born.

After our initial group chat, we met up at Robotica's Hackerspace to brainstorm and flesh out the concept. The energy was electric - just four people excited about creating something new for Montreal's maker community. We debated formats, venues, and ways to keep it engaging while staying true to the core idea: giving people a platform to share their passions in a structured but casual way.
