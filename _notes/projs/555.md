**Summary**

After returning from Toronto and noticing Montreal's nascent community-building scene, I decided to create something new with a few builder friends. We launched 555 nights - a demo evening with a simple format: 5 slides, 5 minutes, 5 minutes of Q&A.

The concept is straightforward: creators, builders, and curious minds gather in the cozy space of Building 21 to share their passions and projects. Each presenter gets exactly 5 minutes to walk through 5 slides about something they're diving deep into - whether it's a side project, research interest, or creative pursuit. This is followed by 5 minutes of engaging Q&A with the audience.

The format creates a perfect balance - enough time to meaningfully share your work, but brief enough to keep energy high and attention focused. We provided amazing chai and snacks to fuel the conversations.
