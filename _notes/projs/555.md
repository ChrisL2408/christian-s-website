**Summary**

After returning from Toronto and noticing Montreal's nascent community-building scene, I decided to create something new with a few builder friends. We launched 555 nights - a demo evening with a simple format: 5 slides, 5 minutes, 5 minutes of Q&A.

The concept is straightforward: creators, builders, and curious minds gather in the cozy space of Building 21 to share their passions and projects. Each presenter gets exactly 5 minutes to walk through 5 slides about something they're diving deep into - whether it's a side project, research interest, or creative pursuit. This is followed by 5 minutes of engaging Q&A with the audience.

The format creates a perfect balance - enough time to meaningfully share your work, but brief enough to keep energy high and attention focused. We provided amazing chai and snacks to fuel the conversations.

**Origin Story**

Thanks for sticking around seems like you have an extra 5 minutes in your day, let me take you through the origin story of 555.

<br>
_October 14_
<br>

I had been thinking of this idea of a presentation nightfor a while, but decided less overthinking and just execute. If I wanted to create something, I can just go and do it and that's what I set out to do.

On October 14th, I created a groupchat on Instagram with a couple of friends and this was how 555 was born.
