**Summary**

After returning from Toronto and noticing Montreal's nascent community-building scene, I decided to create something new with a few builder friends. We launched 555 nights - a demo evening with a simple format: 5 slides, 5 minutes, 5 minutes of Q&A.

The concept is straightforward: creators, builders, and curious minds gather in the cozy space of Building 21 to share their passions and projects. Each presenter gets exactly 5 minutes to walk through 5 slides about something they're diving deep into - whether it's a side project, research interest, or creative pursuit. This is followed by 5 minutes of engaging Q&A with the audience.

The format creates a perfect balance - enough time to meaningfully share your work, but brief enough to keep energy high and attention focused. We provided amazing chai and snacks to fuel the conversations.

**Origin Story**

Thanks for sticking around seems like you have an extra 5 minutes in your day, let me take you through the origin story of 555.

<br>
_October 14_
<br>

I had been thinking of this idea of doing a presentation night for a while, but decided less overthinking and just execute. If I wanted to create something, I can just go and do it and that's what I set out to do.

On October 14th, I created a groupchat on Instagram with a couple of friends and this was how 555 was born.

After our initial group chat, we met up at Robotica's Hackerspace to brainstorm and flesh out the concept. The energy was electric - just four people excited about creating something new for Montreal's maker community. We debated formats, venues, and ways to keep it engaging while staying true to the core idea: giving people a platform to share their passions in a structured but casual way. We ultimately chose Building 21 as our venue - a cozy space at McGill perfect for fostering intimate discussions and creative exchanges.

Notes:

The next couple weeks were a whirlwind of prep. We had people sliding into our DMs left and right wanting to present - the Twitter thread really took off with folks from all corners of Montreal chiming in. Vilakshan was in full project manager mode, sending out those "friendly reminder" emails about slide submissions (you know the ones).

We wanted to make sure this wasn't just another tech bro meetup, so we went out of our way to invite people from totally different scenes - artists, musicians, you name it. The goal was to mix it up and get some fresh perspectives in the room.

Behind the scenes, Vilakshan was going ham on Canva (check out his design process [here](link-to-canva)) while I was playing tetris with everyone's slides trying to make them flow together. We even threw in a buildspace jam at the start to set the vibe right.

The whole thing was coming together piece by piece, and honestly? The chaos was half the fun.

- Add more twitter screenshots of people replying, vilakshan posting etc
- Send out email confirmations for people to submit their slides etc (vilakshan)
- sending personal invites etc (specifically inviting people that were different from us not in tech etc)
- Compiling slides together
- Vilakshan design process (screenshot of canva) --> and recording (live canva link too)
- buildspace song (at the start of the page) --> people enjoy the music while reading this

_November 10_ (D-day!)
<br>

D-day was nuts. Vilakshan and Ricky went on a chai run that turned into a whole adventure - mostly because Ricky couldn't find parking anywhere (near Building 21 at least).
Meanwhile, Simon and I were scrambling to make sure 40 people could have some sort of a seat, while Vilakshan kept blowing up my phone to e-transfer him the chai money in real time lol (he swears hes not broke)!

Just when we thought we had it all figured out, I hit Vilakshan with the "where's the Timbits?" - fuck, he forgot. I sent him over to get them, luckily Tims was opposite Building 21 (shoutout to amazing sponsors) and we were ready to roll!

The real magic kicked off before 6pm when people started flowing in - and holy moly, the vibes were IMMACULATE. Everyone was genuinely hyped to be there, sharing that perfect mix of nervous excitement and creative energy. By 6:15pm, we had our first presenter up and it was just pure gold from there. Eight absolute legends shared their passion projects and random obsessions - each one better than the last. Not gonna spoil all the goodness, but here's a little teaser:

The best part? Watching everyone vibe over homemade chai and Timbits between presentations, making connections and sharing ideas. It wasn't just presentations - it was this perfect mix of cozy hangout meets show-and-tell meets creative playground.

_Extra Notes_

**Challenges**

- Making everyone feel at home

  - To create a space that goes beyond just tech talk
  - Four tech bros hosting meant we wanted focused on bringing different perspectives outside our circle
  - Trying to shift focus to creativity and ideas rather than technical details
  - Keeping presentations casual, conversational and on time
  - Letting room for natural connections to form

- The symphony of logistics
  - Presentation decks materializing minutes before showtime (for Vilakshan procrastinating)
  - The eternal Montreal parking quest (for Ricky)
  - The great chai calculation conundrum (for Vilakshan)
  - Managing unexpected overflow of interest (for Simon)
  - Real-time financial orchestration for refreshments and finding sponsors (for Chris)
  - Technical setup ballet in limited time (for everyone)

**For next time**

- Rebrand from 'passion projects' to 'nerding out' - keeps it casual and fun
- Create a wall of fame with presenter portraits
- Set the mood right - dimmed lights for better vibes
- Explore themed nights (tech/food/art/music?)
- Level up the food game:

  - Let people bring their food (hotpot type situation)
  - Vilakshan's dumplings
  - Host a dumpling-making showdown (thanks tommy for inspo)
