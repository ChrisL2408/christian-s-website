I get it. Sometimes that person who is slightly more qualified than you gets the job, or you get cut from the varsity team because a recent 5-star recruit comes in and takes your starting spot. What if I told you any person can be _lucky_? Many people believe that luck is an external uncontrollable force that happens to other people that gives them a headstart or advantage like the examples above.

However, people who are truly _lucky_ know that everything that happens to them is the result of proactive action.

That person who perhaps was slightly more qualified than you on your resume, spent the last 5 months sending cold emails to company executives to create their _luck_. That athlete who took your spot spent the last decade honing his skills to be the best in that position.

At the end of the day, **only you** can create your own _luck_. You can choose to be lucky if you truly believe it and put in the work...
